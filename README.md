# 👋 Hi, I'm Glaiza!

I'm building this GitHub to share my daily coding journey — one project, challenge, or idea at a time. My goal is to improve my skills, learn consistently, and build a portfolio I’m proud of.

- 💻 Currently learning: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python & Web Development
- 🎯 Goal: Upload code every day for 100 days
- 📁 Main Repo: [Daily-Journal](https://github.com/tanglaiza07/Code-Journal) 

Let's connect and grow together!
